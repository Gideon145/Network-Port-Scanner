# Network-Port-Scanner
This is a simple Python script that scans a target IP or hostname for open ports using basic socket programming. It checks a list of commonly used ports and reports which ones are open.  It’s a beginner-friendly tool meant to demonstrate how port scanning works under the hood — no fancy tools, just raw Python.
